#' @section Multiple Commands:
#'   LTKFunctions generate a separate command for each item when the required parameters are lists.
#'   This is useful when you want to use the same command and options but different input data and
#'   output files. However, this works only when the switches and options are the same for all
#'   commands (not lists). If you try to use a list of switches and/or options and a list of input
#'   files, you will produce commands using all sets of switches and/or options for every input
#'   file.
